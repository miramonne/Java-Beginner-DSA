/*
Create a class called Node to represent the nodes of the linked list. Each node should contain an integer value and a reference to the next node in the list.
Create a class called SinglyLinkedList to represent the linked list itself. The class should have the following methods:
a. insertFront(int value): Inserts a new node with the given value at the front of the list.
b. insertBack(int value): Inserts a new node with the given value at the end of the list.
c. delete(int value): Deletes the first occurrence of the node with the given value from the list, if it exists.
d. search(int value): Returns true if the list contains a node with the given value, otherwise returns false.
e. size(): Returns the number of nodes in the list.
f. isEmpty(): Returns true if the list is empty, otherwise returns false.
g. printList(): Prints the elements of the list in order.
Instructions:

Implement the Node class with the required fields and constructor.
Implement the SinglyLinkedList class with the methods mentioned above.
Test your implementation with various test cases to ensure the correctness of your code.
